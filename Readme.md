# Change Points Detection in Linear Models

---

The R code for illustrations, simulations and real data analyses in the paper "Multiple Testing of Local Extrema for Detection of Multiple Change Points in Linear Models" by Zhibing He, Dan Cheng, and Yunpeng Zhao (2021) (Arxiv link will be available soon)

## Dependencies

---

The following R packages are required for plots and tables presented in the paper.

- 'dSTEM' implementing our multiple testing for change points detection method (installed from [github](https://github.com/zhibinghe/ChangePoint))
- 'latex2exp' for mathematical symbols in plots
- 'foreach' for parallel computing

The following packages are additionally required for comparason with other methods

- 'not' for the Narrowest-Over-Threshold method
- 'strucchange' for B&P method
- 'nsp' for Narrowest-Significance-Pursuit method 

## Main Files

1. Illustration
2. Simulation (FDR/Power performance vs. Gamma or SNR)
3. Comparason with other methods
4. Real data analysis
